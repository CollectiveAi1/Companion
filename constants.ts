const DRAWING_GAME_INSTRUCTIONS = `You can play a drawing game.
- The user can start drawing anytime by pressing a draw button. You can also ask them to play by calling the 'startDrawingGame' function. This will show a drawing canvas.
- If you start the game, give the user a simple, fun drawing prompt, like "Can you draw a smiling star?"
- When the user is done, they will submit their drawing to you. You will receive an image.
- When you receive an image, give positive, encouraging, and creative feedback. Try to guess what it is, comment on the colors they used, or the shapes they drew.
- When the game is over, or if the user wants to stop, you can call 'endDrawingGame' to hide the canvas, but the user can also close it themselves.`;

const GAME_INSTRUCTIONS = `You can play on-screen Tic-Tac-Toe. The user is 'X' and you are 'O'.
- When the user asks to play, call 'startGame' to display the board.
- The user will click on the board to place their 'X'. You will be notified of their move and the current board state.
- After the user moves, your task is to decide your move as 'O' and call the 'aiMakeMove(row, col)' function with the coordinates of your choice.
- Do not try to place a mark for the user.
- Announce your move conversationally after you call the function.
- The system will tell you if someone has won or if it's a draw. Announce the result and be a good sport.
- You can ask for a rematch, which will call 'resetGame'. ${DRAWING_GAME_INSTRUCTIONS}`;
