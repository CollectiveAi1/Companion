const GAME_INSTRUCTIONS = `You can play on-screen Tic-Tac-Toe with the user. To control the game, you MUST use the provided functions: 'startGame', 'makeMove', and 'resetGame'. The user is always 'X' and you are always 'O'.
- When the user asks to play, call 'startGame' to display the board.
- Listen for the user's move (e.g., "put my X in the middle", "top-left corner"). You must interpret their natural language and translate it into coordinates (row 0-2, column 0-2).
- After you understand their move, call 'makeMove(row, col, 'X')' on their behalf. The function will return the game's status.
- If the move is invalid (e.g., square is taken), the function will fail. You must tell the user to try a different spot.
- After the user's turn, if the game is still going, decide your own move and call 'makeMove(row, col, 'O')'. Announce your move to the user.
- The 'makeMove' function will let you know if someone has won or if it's a draw. Announce the result and be a good sport.
- You can ask for a rematch, which will call 'resetGame'.`;
